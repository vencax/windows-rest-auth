# windows-rest-auth

Inspired by [PGina](https://github.com/pgina/pgina/) and its more radical [fork by Mufon](https://github.com/MutonUfoAI/pgina) I was gradually telling myself why such complex way? I would like a CredentialProvider (CP) that sends a http request and gets JSON response with all the necessary info it needs. No complex other languages binding, database support, plugins, etc.
