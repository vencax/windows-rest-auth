# windows-rest-auth

Inspired by [PGina](https://github.com/pgina/pgina/) and its more radical [fork by MutonUfoAI](https://github.com/MutonUfoAI/pgina) I was gradually telling myself why such complex way? I would like a CredentialProvider (CP) that sends a http request and gets JSON response with all the necessary info it needs. 

## Pros
- Simplicity. No complex other languages binding, database support, plugins, etc.
- Installabe thgrough simple script (copy to Win32/64 folder) and add few register keys.
Automatic installation is key feature.
Me as admin I don't want to go and install or manually configure it for every single machine I have.
- Easily configurable (only URL?) which can live within registers as well.
